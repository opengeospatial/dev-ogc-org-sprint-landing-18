The main goals of this code sprint are to support the development of OGC API Records, STAC, ISO 19115 metadata standards and JSON-FG, as well as software which implements those standards/specifications. In addition, it also aims to create awareness about the standards/specifications and software projects. This code sprint takes place on Geovation (London, UK) and at the OGC-events Discord server. It is hosted by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the Technical Committee 211 (TC 211) of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).";
