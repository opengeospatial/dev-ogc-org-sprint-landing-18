- var about = "A Code Sprint is a three day virtual or hybrid event, where dozens of developers from around the world come together to code and share their ideas. The main goals of this code sprint are to support the development of OGC API Records, STAC, ISO 19115 metadata standards and JSON-FG, as well as software which implements those standards/specifications. In addition, it also aims to create awareness about the standards/specifications and software projects. This code sprint takes place on Geovation (London, UK) and at the OGC-events Discord server. It is hosted by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Technical Committee 211 (TC 211) of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC) community.";
